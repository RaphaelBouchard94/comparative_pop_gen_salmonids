# Analysis done in the paper titled:
## Shared Dispersal Patterns but Contrasting Levels of Gene Flow in Two Anadromous Salmonids Along a Broad Subarctic Coastal Gradient

`brook_charr_angsd_pipeline` and `whitefish_angsd_pipeline` are the scripts that process the bam files using angsd to get genotype likelihood and run population structure analysis on the servers such as pca, admixture, WGSassign.

`R_analysis` is the collection of Rscripts that I ran on my local computer to produce figures that appear on the paper. 

This is the page that compiles the scripts needed to replicate the analysis in the paper.
